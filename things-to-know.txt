About selenium:
1. While catching items using the By class, use . instead of space if the locator of the element has spaces.
For example, 'btn.btn-warning.webpage-extend' instead of 'btn btn-warning webpage_extend'.

2. Go for the absolute path rather than the relative path.


note for tomorrow

made code such a way that it downloads necessary driver on its own.
completed storing cookies so that log in info is saved. don't have to login again and again. make sure to specify absolute path for the 
cookies location.
